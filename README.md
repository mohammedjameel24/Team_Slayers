  - T1: {Milk, Bread}
  - T2: {Milk, Diaper, Beer, Eggs}
  - T3: {Milk, Bread, Diaper, Beer}
  - T4: {Bread, Milk, Diaper, Beer}

2. **Second Pass:**
   - Generate candidate 2-itemsets: {Milk, Bread}, {Milk, Diaper}, {Milk, Beer}, {Bread, Diaper}, {Bread, Beer}, {Diaper, Beer}
   - Calculate support for 2-itemsets: {Milk, Bread: 3, Milk, Diaper: 3, Milk, Beer: 2, Bread, Diaper: 3, Bread, Beer: 2, Diaper, Beer: 3}

**Differentiate Between Predictive and Descriptive Data Mining Using Some Examples in a Table Format**

| Feature                         | Predictive Data Mining                    | Descriptive Data Mining                   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Predict future trends or behaviors        | Describe patterns and relationships in data|
| **Techniques**                  | Regression, Classification, Time-series Analysis | Clustering, Association Rule Mining, Summarization |
| **Outcome**                     | Predictive models (e.g., forecasting sales) | Descriptive summaries (e.g., market segments) |
| **Example Applications**        | Credit scoring, Stock price prediction    | Market basket analysis, Customer segmentation |
| **Data Requirement**            | Historical labeled data                   | Historical data (labeled or unlabeled)     |

**Explain Steps of Data Preprocessing**

**Steps:**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Remove noise, handle missing values, and correct inconsistencies.
   - **Methods:** Imputation, outlier removal.
2. **Data Integration:** Combine data from multiple sources into a coherent dataset.
   - **Methods:** Data warehousing, database integration.
3. **Data Transformation:** Convert data into suitable formats for analysis.
   - **Methods:** Normalization, aggregation, generalization.
4. **Data Reduction:** Reduce the volume but produce the same or similar analytical results.
   - **Methods:** Dimensionality reduction, data compression, feature selection.
5. **Data Discretization:** Convert continuous data into discrete intervals.
   - **Methods:** Binning, histogram analysis.

**Data Cleaning Example:**
- **Original:** [12, null, 15, null, 18]
- **Cleaned:** [12, 13.5 (mean imputation), 15, 13.5, 18]

**Describe About Data Modelling**

**Data Modelling:**
- **Definition:** The process of creating a data model to represent data structures and relationships.
- **Types:**
  1. **Conceptual Data Model:** High-level description of the data, entities, and relationships.
     - **Example:** Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
  2. **Logical Data Model:** Detailed blueprint of the data, including attributes, data types, and relationships.
     - **Example:** Relational schema.
  3. **Physical Data Model:** Implementation-specific model, showing how data is stored in the database.
     - **Example:** SQL tables, indexes.
- **Importance:**
  - Ensures consistency and quality of data.
  - Facilitates communication between stakeholders.
  - Guides database design and implementation.

**Write Short Notes**

1. **Time-series Analysis:**
   - **Definition:** Analyzing time-ordered data points to identify trends, cycles, and seasonal variations.
   - **Techniques:**
     - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** For modeling and forecasting.
     - **Exponential Smoothing:** For smoothing data and making short-term forecasts.
   - **Applications:** Stock market analysis, weather forecasting, sales forecasting.

2. **Classification:**
   - **Definition:** Assigning items to predefined categories or classes.
   - **Techniques:**
     - **Decision Trees:** Tree-like models of decisions.
     - **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ theorem.
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes.
   - **Applications:** Spam detection, credit scoring, medical diagnosis.

3. **Association:**
   - **Definition:** Finding interesting relationships between variables in large databases.
   - **Techniques:**
     - **Apriori Algorithm:** For mining frequent itemsets and association rules.
     - **FP-Growth Algorithm:** Efficiently finds frequent patterns without candidate generation.
   - **Applications:** Market basket analysis, recommendation systems, cross-selling.

**How is data warehouse different and similar to a database?**

- **Similar:** Both store data systematically.
- **Different:** A data warehouse is optimized for analytical queries and reporting, whereas a database is optimized for transaction processing.

**What is data Discretization?**

- The process of converting continuous data into discrete intervals or categories.

**Explain Graph Mining.**

- The process of discovering patterns, structures, and useful information from graphs representing relationships among data points.

**Explain Metadata repository.**

- A centralized database that stores metadata, which is data about data, including data definitions, structures, and information about data usage.

**What is Bayesian classification and list its advantage.**

- **Definition:** A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Advantage:** Simplicity and effectiveness with small datasets and independent features.
